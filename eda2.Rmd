#### EDA (A diagram from R4DS by H.W. and G.G.) {-}

![EDA from r4ds](./data/data-science.png)

**Today**: R Markdown and `dplyr`

## R Markdown

### What is R Markdown Notebook

R Markdown provides an authoring framework for data science. You can use a single R Markdown file to both

* save and execute code
* generate high quality reports that can be shared with an audience

R Notebooks are an implementation of Literate Programming that allows for direct interaction with R while producing a reproducible document with publication-quality output.

An R Notebook is an R Markdown document with chunks that can be executed independently and interactively, with output visible immediately beneath the input.

(Reference: [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide, 3.2 Notebook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/notebook.html))

---

### Two Goodies

* **Important and Essential**: Reproducible Research with Literate Programming

* **Useful to Render Vairous Formats**: R Notebook (HTML), R Markdown (HTML), PDF, MS Word, MS Powerpoint, Ioslides Presentation (HTML), Slidy Presentatoin (HTML), Beamer Presentation (PDF)

### Records of EDA and Communication

1. Memo on scratch paper: R Scripts
2. Record on a notebook: R Notebook (a type of an R Markdown format)
3. Short paper or a digital communication: R Notebook
3. Paper or a report: R Markdown (html, pdf, or MS Word)
4. Presentation
  * R Markdown with a presentation format (html, pdf, or PowerPoint)
6. Publication of a Book
  * [BOOKDOWN: Write HTML, PDF, ePub, and Kindle books with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org). Free online document is provided in [pdf as well](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown.pdf)
  - [Arxive Page](https://bookdown.org/home/archive/) 



### R Studio Setup

1. Start R Studio
2. Create a Project
3. Tool > Install Packages `rmarkdown`
    * Or on Console: `install.packages("rmarkdown")`
4. Tool > Install Packages `tinytex` (for pdf generation)
5. Let's try!  
    a. File > New File > R Notebook
    b. Save with a file name, say, test-notebook
    c. Preview by [Preview] button
    d. Run Code Chunk `plot(cars)` and then Preview again.
    e. Knit PDF, Word (and HTML)

Note: R Notebooks are relatively new feature of RStudio and are only available in version 1.0 or higher of RStudio. 

### Default YAML: R Notebook, HTML, PDF, WORD

```
---
title: "The Title of This R Notebook"
author: "Your Name"
date: "2021-12-22"
output:
  html_notebook: default
  html_document: default
  word_document: default
  pdf_document: default
---

```

* Original format is `output: html_document`
* Indention matters in YAML. So it is safer to copy and paste `output:` to `pdf_document: default`
* R Notebook is also an HTML format, so html_notebook part may disappear after knitting in HTML.

### An Example of R Notebooks

1. Moodle: QALL401 2021W 2021-12-22 Examples of R Notebook

2. Open the file 

  * R Codes with Outputs
  * Headings, Links, Explanations, etc.
  * [Hide] button, and [Code] button with a menu
  * Choose: Download Rmd

3. Save as "_file_name_.nb.html" in your R project directory

4. Download and Save "jhu_covid.Rmd". (Or, open the file in editor)

5. Preview by [Preview] button.

6. Knit to other formats, e.g. Word under [Preview] button

N.B. If Step 4 does not work, create a new R Notebook and copy and paste [R Markdown Source File] in Moodle


### Knit, Notebook Mode and Preview of Default.Rmd

1. Knit to HTML
2. Knit to PDF (require \TeX \ system, install `tinytex` package)
3. Knit to Word
4. Controlling a code chunk and its output

  * Highlight and run
  * Run all chunks above
  * Expand, collapse and clear output
  * Show output in other window
  * Modify chunk options

5. Output Options:

  * Notebook, HTML, PDF, Word
  * General, Figures and Advanced

### `yaml` - YAML Ain't a Markup Language - Example

```

```

### Why R Markdown?

#### R Markdown Cheat Sheet

* .Rmd files: 
An R Markdown (.Rmd) file is a record of your research. It contains 
  1. the code that a scientist needs to reproduce your work along with 
  2. the narration that a reader needs to understand your work.
* Reproducible Research: 
At the click of a button, or the type
of a command, you can rerun the
code in an R Markdown file to Rmd reproduce your work and export
the results as a finished report.
* Dynamic Documents: 
You can choose to export the finished report as a html, nb.html, pdf, MS Word, ODT, RTF, or markdown document; or as a html or pdf based slide show.




### Literate Programming by D. Knuth

Literate programming is an approach to programming introduced by Donald Knuth in which a program is given as an explanation of the program logic in a natural language, such as English, interspersed with snippets of macros and traditional source code, from which a compilable source code can be generated

#### [D. Knuth](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/donald_knuth_181634)
Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs: Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.

### Reproducible Research - Quote from a Coursera Course

#### [Reproducible Research](https://www.coursera.org/learn/reproducible-research)

Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them.  The need for reproducibility is increasing dramatically as data analyses become more complex, involving larger datasets and more sophisticated computations. Reproducibility allows for people to focus on the actual content of a data analysis, rather than on superficial details reported in a written summary. In addition, reproducibility makes an analysis more useful to others because the data and code that actually conducted the analysis are available. 

### [R Markdown workflow, R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown-workflow.html#r-markdown-workflow)

R Markdown is also important because it so tightly integrates prose and code. This makes it a great analysis notebook because it lets you develop code and record your thoughts. It:

* Records what you did and why you did it. Regardless of how great your memory is, if you don’t record what you do, there will come a time when you have forgotten important details. Write them down so you don’t forget!

* Supports rigorous thinking. You are more likely to come up with a strong analysis if you record your thoughts as you go, and continue to reflect on them. This also saves you time when you eventually write up your analysis to share with others.

* Helps others understand your work. It is rare to do data analysis by yourself, and you’ll often be working as part of a team. A lab notebook helps you share why you did it with your colleagues or lab mates.

#### Examples of yaml

```

# Part II: Data Transforamtion with `dplyr`

## `dplyr` [Overview](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org)

dplyr is a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges:

* `select()` picks variables based on their names.
* `filter()` picks cases based on their values.
* `mutate()` adds new variables that are functions of existing variables
* `summarise()` reduces multiple values down to a single summary.
* `arrange()` changes the ordering of the rows.
* `group_by()` takes an existing tbl and converts it into a grouped tbl.

You can learn more about them in vignette("dplyr"). As well as these single-table verbs, dplyr also provides a variety of two-table verbs, which you can learn about in vignette("two-table").

If you are new to dplyr, the best place to start is [the data transformation chapter in R for data science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html).

---

### [`select`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/select.html): Subset columns using their names and types

Helper Function	| Use	| Example
---|-------|--------
-	| Columns except	| select(babynames, -prop)
:	| Columns between (inclusive)	| select(babynames, year:n)
contains() |	Columns that contains a string |	select(babynames, contains("n"))
ends_with()	| Columns that ends with a string	| select(babynames, ends_with("n"))
matches()	| Columns that matches a regex |	select(babynames, matches("n"))
num_range()	| Columns with a numerical suffix in the range | Not applicable with babynames
one_of() |	Columns whose name appear in the given set |	select(babynames, one_of(c("sex", "gender")))
starts_with()	| Columns that starts with a string	| select(babynames, starts_with("n"))

---

### [`filter`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html): Subset rows using column values

Logical operator	| tests	| Example
--|-----|---
>	| Is x greater than y? |	x > y
>=	| Is x greater than or equal to y? |	x >= y
<	| Is x less than y?	| x < y
<=	| Is x less than or equal to y? | 	x <= y
==	| Is x equal to y? |	x == y
!=	| Is x not equal to y? |	x != y
is.na()	| Is x an NA?	| is.na(x)
!is.na() |	Is x not an NA? |	!is.na(x)

---

### [`arrange`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/arrange.html) and `Pipe %>%`

* `arrange()` orders the rows of a data frame by the values of selected columns.

Unlike other `dplyr` verbs, `arrange()` largely ignores grouping; you need to explicitly mention grouping variables (`or use .by_group = TRUE) in order to group by them, and functions of variables are evaluated once per data frame, not once per group.

* [`pipes`](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html) in R for Data Science.

---

### [`mutate`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html) 

* Create, modify, and delete columns

* Useful mutate functions

  - +, -, log(), etc., for their usual mathematical meanings

  - lead(), lag()

  - dense_rank(), min_rank(), percent_rank(), row_number(), cume_dist(), ntile()

  - cumsum(), cummean(), cummin(), cummax(), cumany(), cumall()

  - na_if(), coalesce()### `group_by()` and `summarise()`

---

* [`group_by`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/group_by.html)

---

* [`summarise` or `summarize`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise.html)

```{r}
iris %>% 
  group_by(Species) %>% 
  summarize(sl = mean(Sepal.Length), sw = mean(Sepal.Width), 
  pl = mean(Petal.Length), pw = mean(Petal.Width))
```

---

#### Summary functions

So far our summarise() examples have relied on sum(), max(), and mean(). But you can use any function in summarise() so long as it meets one criteria: the function must take a vector of values as input and return a single value as output. Functions that do this are known as summary functions and they are common in the field of descriptive statistics. Some of the most useful summary functions include:

1. Measures of location - mean(x), median(x), quantile(x, 0.25), min(x), and max(x)
2. Measures of spread - sd(x), var(x), IQR(x), and mad(x)
3. Measures of position - first(x), nth(x, 2), and last(x)
4. Counts - n_distinct(x) and n(), which takes no arguments, and returns the size of the current group or data frame.
5. Counts and proportions of logical values - sum(!is.na(x)), which counts the number of TRUEs returned by a logical test; mean(y == 0), which returns the proportion of TRUEs returned by a logical test.


  - if_else(), recode(), case_when()

2. Try RMarkdown: HTML, PDF, Word
3. Try R Notebook:
  - Code Chunk
  - RStudio Help
  - Visual Editor
  - Download from Moodle
  - Export and import files
  - _file name_.nb.html and _file name_.Rmd
4. YAML

### `ggplot2` [Overview](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org)

`ggplot2` is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on [The Grammar of Graphics](https://amzn.to/2ef1eWp). You provide the data, tell ggplot2 how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details.

**Examples**
```
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```
```
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy))
```

**Template**
```
ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))
```

## The Week Two Assignment (in Moodle)

-   Pick two data from the built-in dataset. (`library(help = "datasets")` or go to the site [The R Datasets Package](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html))

    -   One of them can be `iris` but do not choose `cars` or `AirPassengers`.
    -   `ggplot2` examples of `cars`, `iris` and `AirPassengers` are given below.

-   Create an R Notebook of a Data Analysis containing the following and submit the rendered HTML file (*file name*.nb.html):

    1.  title, date, and author, i.e., Your Name
    2.  an explanation of the data and the variables
    3.  at least one code chunk containing the following:

    -   `head()`, `str()`

    4.  for each dataset, at least one code chunk containing graphs using ggplot2. Please try at least two `geoms`:

    -   `geom_hist()`, `geom_boxplot()`, `goem_col()`, etc.
    -   `geom_line()`, `geom_point()`, etc.

    5.  your findings and/or questions
    6.  file name: ID.nb.html, e.g. 123456.nb.html
    7.  option: `median()`, `mean()`, `sd()` of a quantitative (numeric) variable, `cor()` of two quantitative (numeric) variables (or a correlation table)

-   Submit your R Notebook file to Moodle (The Third Assignment) by 2021-01-11 23:59:00


### Note on R Notebook

Please note the following.

* There are essentially three modes: R Scripts, R Notebook and R Markdown. 
* R Notebook is a special type of R Markdown but please use R Notebook at least for Suzuki's assignments.
* To start, choose R Notebook from New File in the File Menu. If you started with R Markdown, please switch it with the Preview button hidden under the triangle on the right of the knit button. 
* The file we preview has the name _file name_.nb.html. For example if the original file name is a3_12345.Rmd, then a3_12345.nb.html is created. You can check it using Files tab.
* When you preview R Notebook, on the top right, you can find Code button. If you press it you also can find download Rmd, which is the source of R Notebook you edited. In this way we can share both the outputs and the source.
* One difficulty is that you cannot include the outputs of the code chunk in the preview. 
* Check Preview on Save and/or save the file before preview, i.e., pressing the preview button. 
* Select Run all under Run button. Then all outputs apear on your editor and all outputs will appear in your preview.
* If some of your code chunks have problems, run each code chunk from top to bottom so that all outputs appear in your editor or viewer.
* When you share your R Notebook, do not forget to share _file name_.nb.html.
* If you have a _file name_.nb.html, then find it from Files in R Studio, you can automatically create _file name_.Rmd to edit the source. 
* To create a fancy document with R Notebook, see the Markdown Quick Reference under Help on top menu for the editor. If you are using Visual Editor using A bottun on top left pane, see https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/. 
* R Studio introduced Visual Editor last year. It seems to be stable but it is not perfect to go back and forth from the original editor using tags. I always use the original editor and I am confident on all the functions of it but I do not have much experience on Visual Editor.  


## Responses to the Week Three Assignment

### Setup

We load two packages; `datasets` and `ggplot2`. The `datasets` are loaded automatically and you do not need the first line of the followiong code chunk. But it is safer to include it because some data names are used previously for different purposes.

```{r}
library(datasets)
library(ggplot2)
```

For explanation, we use the following population data of WDI.

```{r}
library(WDI)
pop <- WDI(
  country = c("NG", "BD", "RU", "MX", "JP"), 
  indicator = c(population = "SP.POP.TOTL"),
  start = 1960, end = 2020)
head(pop)
```
