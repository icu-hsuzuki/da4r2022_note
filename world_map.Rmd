### Exploratory Data Analysis

#### What is EDA (Posit Primers: [Visualise Data](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/3.1))

1. EDA is an iterative cycle that helps you understand what your data says. When you do EDA, you:

2. Generate questions about your data

3. Search for answers by visualising, transforming, and/or modeling your data

Use what you learn to refine your questions and/or generate new questions

EDA is an important part of any data analysis. You can use EDA to make discoveries about the world; or you can use EDA to ensure the quality of your data, asking questions about whether the data meets your standards or not.

### Open and Public Data, World Bank

#### [Open Government Data Toolkit](http://opendatatoolkit.worldbank.org): [Open Data Defined](http://opendatatoolkit.worldbank.org/en/essentials.html)

The term ``Open Data'' has a very precise meaning. Data or content is open if anyone is free to use, re-use or redistribute it, subject at most to measures that preserve provenance and openness.

1. The data must be \underline{legally open}, which means they must be placed in the public domain or under liberal terms of use with minimal restrictions.
2. The data must be \underline{technically open}, which means they must be published in electronic formats that are machine readable and non-proprietary, so that anyone can access and use the data using common, freely available software tools. Data must also be publicly available and accessible on a public server, without password or firewall restrictions. To make Open Data easier to find, most organizations create and manage Open Data catalogs.

### Function WDI

* **Usage**

```
WDI(country = "all",
    indicator = "NY.GDP.PCAP.KD",
    start = 1960,
    end = 2020,
    extra = FALSE,
    cache = NULL)
```

* **Arguments** See Help!
  - country: Vector of countries (ISO-2 character codes, e.g. "BR", "US", "CA", or "all") 
  - indicator: If you supply a named vector, the indicators will be automatically renamed: `c('women_private_sector' = 'BI.PWK.PRVS.FE.ZS')`

---

### Function WDIsearch

```{r}
library(WDI)
```
```{r}
WDIsearch(string = "NY.GDP.PCAP.KD", 
          field = "indicator", cache = NULL)
```

---

```{r}
WDIsearch(string = "population", 
          field = "name", short=FALSE, cache = wdi_cache)
```

---

```
WDIsearch(string = "NY.GDP.PCAP.KD", 
  field = "indicator", short = FALSE, cache = NULL)
```
```
WDIsearch(string = "gdp", 
  field = "name", short = TRUE, cache = NULL) 
```

---

### Use cash

WDIbulk downloads the zip file of Bulk Downloads in [WDI site](https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/) , it is a list containing 6 data frames: Data, Country, Series, Country-Series, Series-Time, FootNote.

`timeout`: integer maximum number of seconds to wait for download



```{r cash=TRUE}
wdi <- WDIbulk(timeout = 600)
```
---

#### Bulk Downloads: Data

```{r}
wdi$Data  
```

---

#### Bulk Downloads: Country

```{r}
wdi$Country  
```

---

#### Bulk Downloads: Series

```{r}
wdi$Series 
```

---

#### Bulk Downloads: Country-Series

```{r}
wdi$`Country-Series`  
```

---

#### Bulk Downloads: Series-Time

```{r}
wdi$`Series-Time`  
```

---

#### Bulk Downloads: Footnote

```{r}
wdi$FootNote 
```

---

### WDIcache

Download an updated list of available WDI indicators from the World Bank website. Returns a list for use in the WDIsearch function.

```{r cash=TRUE}
wdi_cache <- WDIcache()
```

Downloading all series information from the World Bank website can take time. The WDI package ships with a local data object with information on all the series available on 2012-06-18. You can update this database by retrieving a new list using `WDIcache`, and then feeding the resulting object to `WDIsearch` via the cache argument.

---

```{r}
wdi_cache
```


---

### WDI_data

List of 2 data frames

The first character matrix includes a full list of WDI series. This list is updated semi-regularly. Users can refresh the list manually using the 'WDIcache()' function and search in the updated list using the 'cache' argument.


```{r}
glimpse(WDI_data)
```

---

```{r}
WDI_data$series
```

---

```{r}
WDI_data$country
```

```{r}
WDI_data$country  %>% filter(country == "Japan")
```

---

```{r}
WDIsearch(string = "gdp", 
  field = "name", short = FALSE, cache = wdi_cache) 
```

---

EDA is an important part of any data analysis. You can use EDA to make discoveries about the world; or you can use EDA to ensure the quality of your data, asking questions about whether the data meets your standards or not.

#### Two useful questions

There is no rule about which questions you should ask to guide your research. However, two types of questions will always be useful for making discoveries within your data. You can loosely word these questions as:

1. What type of variation occurs within my variables?
2. What type of covariation occurs between my variables?

The rest of this tutorial will look at these two questions. To make the discussion easier, letâ€™s define some termsâ€¦
