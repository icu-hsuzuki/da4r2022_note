This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute or run a code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button, a triangle pointing right,  within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter* (Win) or *Cmd+Shift+Enter* (Mac). 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Option+I* (Win) or *Cmd+Option+I* (Mac).

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* (Win) or *Cmd+Shift+K* (Mac) to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

There are three lines of options in the top YAML. If you delete \#, the line becomes active.

* number_sections: yes    # for automatic numbering of sections
* toc: true               # for table of contents
* toc_float: true         # for floating table of contents
