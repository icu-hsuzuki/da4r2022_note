### Data Science and EDA

#### Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science

> An inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from many structural and unstructured data.

* Create Insights
* Impact Decision Making
* Maintain & Improve Overtime



### What is R?

#### R (programming language), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language))

* **R is a programming language** and **free software** environment for **statistical computing and graphics** supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. 

* The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis.

* A **GNU package**, the official R software environment is written primarily in C, Fortran, and R itself (thus, it is partially self-hosting) and is freely available under the GNU General Public License. 

#### History of R and more

"R Programming for Data Science" by Roger Peng

* [Chapter 2. History and Overview of R](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/history-and-overview-of-r.html)
* [Overview and History of R: Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STihTnVSZnI&feature=youtu.be)

### Why R? -- Responses by Hadley Wickham

#### [r4ds](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html#python-julia-and-friends): R is a great place to start your data science journey because

* R is an environment designed from the ground up to support data science. 
* R is not just a programming language, but it is also an interactive environment for doing data science. 
* To support interaction, R is a much more flexible language than many of its peers. 

#### Why R today?

When you talk about choosing programming languages, I always say you shouldn’t pick them based on technical merits, but rather pick them based on the community. And I think the R community is like really, really strong, vibrant, free, welcoming, and embraces a wide range of domains. So, if there are like people like you using R, then your life is going to be much easier. That’s the first reason. 

**Interview**: ["Advice to Young (and Old) Programmers, H. Wickham"](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2018/08/advice-to-young-and-old-programmers-a-conversation-with-hadley-wickham/)


### What is RStudio? https://rstudio.com

> RStudio is an integrated development environment, or IDE, for R programming. 

#### R Studio (Wikipedia)

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R, a programming language for statistical computing and graphics. It is available in two formats: RStudio Desktop is a regular desktop application while RStudio Server runs on a remote server and allows accessing RStudio using a web browser.



### Installation of R and R Studio

#### R Installation

To download R, go to CRAN, the comprehensive R archive network. CRAN is composed of a set of mirror servers distributed around the world and is used to distribute R and R packages. Don’t try and pick a mirror that’s close to you: instead use the cloud mirror, https://cloud.r-project.org, which automatically figures it out for you.

A new major version of R comes out once a year, and there are 2-3 minor releases each year. It’s a good idea to update regularly.

#### R Studio Installation

Download and install it from http://www.rstudio.com/download. 

RStudio is updated a couple of times a year. When a new version is available, RStudio will let you know.

### R Studio

#### The First Step
1. Start R Studio Application
2. Top Menu: File > New Project > New Directory > New Project > _Directory name or Browse the directory and choose the parent directory you want to create the directory_

#### When You Start the Project
1. Go to the directory you created
2. Double click _'Directory Name'.Rproj
  
Or,

1. Start R Studio
2. File > Open Project (or choose from Recent Project)

_In this way the working directory of the session is set to the project directory and R can search releted files without difficulty_ (`getwd()`, `setwd()`)


### Posit Cloud

RStudio Cloud is a lightweight, cloud-based solution that allows anyone to do, share, teach and learn data science online.

#### Cloud Free

* Up to 15 projects total
* 1 shared space (5 members and 10 projects max)
* 15 project hours per month
* Up to 1 GB RAM per project
* Up to 1 CPU per project
* Up to 1 hour background execution time

#### How to Start Posit Cloud

1. Go to https://posit.cloud/
2. Sign Up: _top right_
  - Email address or Google account
3. New Project: _Project Name_
4. R Console

## Let's Get Started

Start RStudio and create a project, or login to Posit Cloud and create a project.



### The First Examples

Input the following codes into Console in the left bottom pane.

* The first two:

```{r}
head(cars)
```

```{r}
str(cars)
```

* Two more:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```


```{r}
plot(cars)
```

* And three more:

```{r}
plot(cars) # cars: Speed and Stopping Distances of Cars
abline(lm(cars$dist~cars$speed))
```


```{r}
lm(cars$dist~cars$speed)
```


```{r}
summary(lm(cars$dist~cars$speed))
```

#### Brief Explanation

* `head(cars)`: The first 6 rows of the pre-installed data `cars`.
* `str(cars)`: The data structure of the pre-installed data `cars`.
* `summary(cars)`: The summary of the pre-installed data `cars`.
* `plot(cars)`: A scatter plot of the pre-installed data `cars`.
  - `plot(cars$dist~cars$speed)`
  - `cars$dist`, `cars$[[2]]`, `cars[,2]` are same
* `abline(lm(cars$dist~cars$speed))`: Add a regression line of a linear model
* `lm(cars$dist~cars$speed)`: The equation of the regression line
* `summary(lm(cars$dist~cars$speed: The summary of the linear regression model

#### View and help

* `View(cars)`
* `?cars`: same as `help(cars)`
* `??cars`: same as `help.search("cars")

#### `datasets`

* `?datasets`
* `library(help = "datasets")`

### Practicum

Pick a data in the datasets package and try

* `head()`
* `str()`
* `summary()`

and some more.

#### `iris`

```{r}
head(iris)
```
```{r}
str(iris)
```
```{r}
summary(iris)
```

Can you plot?

```{r}
plot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width)
```

#### coronavirus.R

The script and its outputs.
__coronavirus.csv__ is too large

```{r cash = TRUE}
# https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html
# JHU Covid-19 global time series data
# See R pakage coronavirus at: https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus
# Data taken from: https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus/tree/master/csv
# Last Updated
Sys.Date()

## Download and read csv (comma separated value) file
coronavirus <- read.csv("https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus/raw/master/csv/coronavirus.csv")
# write.csv(coronavirus, "data/coronavirus.csv")

## Summaries and structures of the data
head(coronavirus)
str(coronavirus)
coronavirus$date <- as.Date(coronavirus$date)
str(coronavirus)

range(coronavirus$date)
unique(coronavirus$country)
unique(coronavirus$type)

## Set Country
COUNTRY <- "Japan"
df0 <- coronavirus[coronavirus$country == COUNTRY,]
head(df0)
tail(df0)
(pop <- df0$population[1])
df <- df0[c(1,6,7,13)]
str(df)
head(df)
### alternatively,
head(df0[c("date", "type", "cases", "population")])
###

## Set types
df_confirmed <- df[df$type == "confirmed",]
df_death <- df[df$type == "death",]
df_recovery <- df[df$data_type == "recovery",]
head(df_confirmed)
head(df_death)
head(df_recovery)

## Histogram
plot(df_confirmed$date, df_confirmed$cases, type = "h")
plot(df_death$date, df_death$cases, type = "h")
# plot(df_recovered$date, df_recovered$cases, type = "h") # no data for recovery

## Scatter plot and correlation
plot(df_confirmed$cases, df_death$cases, type = "p")
cor(df_confirmed$cases, df_death$cases)


## In addition set a period
start_date <- as.Date("2021-07-01")
end_date <- Sys.Date() 
df_date <- df[df$date >=start_date & df$date <= end_date,]
##

## Set types
df_date_confirmed <- df_date[df_date$type == "confirmed",]
df_date_death <- df_date[df_date$type == "death",]
df_date_recovery <- df_date[df_date$data_type == "recovery",]
head(df_date_confirmed)
head(df_date_death)
head(df_date_recovery)

## Histogram
plot(df_date_confirmed$date, df_date_confirmed$cases, type = "h")
plot(df_date_death$date, df_date_death$cases, type = "h")
# plot(df_date_recovered$date, df_date_recovered$cases, type = "h") # no data for recovery

plot(df_date_confirmed$cases, df_date_death$cases, type = "p")
cor(df_date_confirmed$cases, df_date_death$cases)

### Q0. Change the values of the location and the period and see the outcomes.
### Q1. What is the correlation between df_confirmed$cases and df_death$cases?
### Q2. Do we have a larger correlation value if we shift the dates to implement the time-lag?
### Q3. Do you have any other questions to explore?

#### Extra
plot(df_confirmed$date, df_confirmed$cases, type = "h", 
     main = paste("Comfirmed Cases in",COUNTRY), 
     xlab = "Date", ylab = "Number of Cases")
```

When you are at the R prompt (>):

1. Typing skip() allows you to skip the current question.
2. Typing play() lets you experiment with R on your own; swirl will ignore what you do...
3. UNTIL you type nxt() which will regain swirl's attention.
4. Typing bye() causes swirl to exit. Your progress will be saved.
5. Typing main() returns you to swirl's main menu.
6. Typing info() displays these options again.

#### Final Remark

You will encounter the message like ‘Would you like to receive credit for completing this course on Coursera.org?’ at the end of each course. This is for `coursera` courses. Select 'NO'.
